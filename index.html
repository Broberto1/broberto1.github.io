      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>One of the best bands in the world!The band was formed in 09 by Tyler Joseph Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, both of whom left in 2011. Since then its been a duo of Tyler and new band mate Josh Dun.The band has had their songs in major motion pictures like Suicide Squad. </p>
  

      <p>Thier music has changed and grew over the years. Starting out back in 2009 their music was more soft and mellow. As time has passed its gotten more deep with the tones they use in their music. Combined with the lyrics their music comes out kinda poetic in nature.</p>
      

      <p>I always felt safe and strong listening to them. They've helped me and im sure alot more people during hard times. Im gratful to live in a time to hear their music.</p>
